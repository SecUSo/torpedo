DetermineUrlButtonUeberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
DetermineUrlButtonErklaerung = The domain (bold area) of the URL is not the target domain. Therefore, TORPEDO can not classify the risk of clicking on this link. This is a domain of a so-called short URL service. In order to classify the risk of the target domain, TORPEDO would have to identify the target URL. It is recommended to do so first.
DetermineUrlButtonInfotext = Based on the structure of the deposited URL, TORPEDO recognizes that this domain is the domain of a short URL service. In order to identify the target URL and thus the target domain, it is necessary to request a corresponding resolve service. As a result, the operator of this service knows that you are potentially interested in this URL. Therefore, if you instruct TORPEDO to identify the target URL, your privacy is at risk (even if you call up the short URL service yourself to identify the target URL). If you do not want this, it is recommended to ask the sender to send you the target URL directly. There is no security risk because it does not call up the URL. Only the resolver service asks for the target URL. 
DetermineUrlButtonGluehbirneText = <label class="highlight">Let TORPEDO identify the target domain.</label> Then you will see another tooltip with information about the target URL and the target domain.

T32Infotext = This means that the domain (bold area) of the URL and thus its trustworthiness is not known to TORPEDO. It is not among the most frequently visited domains in Germany. Also, URLs with this domain have not been visited many times by you in the past or have been identified as trustable by you in the past. In addition, TORPEDO has discovered at least one indicator that is often used in fraudulent e-mails to fool you. The indicators include e.g. 1) a difference between the displayed URL in the text and the deposited URL; 2) the fact that the domain of the URL behind this link is very similar to the ones identified as trustable by you or by TORPEDO; 3) if a URL is additionally displayed in the tooltip and it differs from the actual URL after the link.

T4Ueberschrift = Referred URL (also known as web address):
T4Erklaerung = This URL has already been associated with phishing about Corona or Covid-19. TORPEDO estimates the risk as high. However, if you believe that this is a legitimate URL, you can click on 'Activate link' below. You should then check the URL again carefully.
T4Infotext = The Cyber Threat Coalition aims to collect a list of fraudulent URLs that have appeared in connection with phishing and Corona or Covid-19 in a blacklist. This is because these URLs are currently appearing in a large number and in rapidly changing variants. We want to contribute to this and temporarily integrate a blacklist into TORPEDO so that you are protected against these URLs.

ShortURLUeberschrift = Referred URL (also known as web address):
ShortURLErklaerung = This domain (highlighted part) is not the target URL. You will be redirected to another URL. To classify the risk of the target URL, TORPEDO would have to detect the target URL.\n\nThis does not happen automatically, as the detection would put your privacy at risk.
ShortURLInfotext = From the structure of the referred URL TORPEDO recognizes that this is the domain of a short URL service.To detect the target URL, it is necessary to call up the short URL service. This would let the service provider know that you are potentially interested in this URL. Therefore, tasking TORPEDO with detecting the target URL would put your privacy at risk (even if you call up the short URL service yourself to detect the target URL). You can avoid this by asking the sender to send the target URL to you directly.
