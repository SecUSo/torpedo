DetermineUrlButtonUeberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
DetermineUrlButtonErklaerung = The domain (bold area) of the URL is not the target domain. Therefore, TORPEDO can not classify the risk of clicking on this link. This is a domain of a so-called short URL service. In order to classify the risk of the target domain, TORPEDO would have to identify the target URL. It is recommended to do so first.
DetermineUrlButtonInfotext = Based on the structure of the deposited URL, TORPEDO recognizes that this domain is the domain of a short URL service. In order to identify the target URL and thus the target domain, it is necessary to request a corresponding resolve service. As a result, the operator of this service knows that you are potentially interested in this URL. Therefore, if you instruct TORPEDO to identify the target URL, your privacy is at risk (even if you call up the short URL service yourself to identify the target URL). If you do not want this, it is recommended to ask the sender to send you the target URL directly. There is no security risk because it does not call up the URL. Only the resolver service asks for the target URL. 
DetermineUrlButtonGluehbirneText = <label class="highlight">Let TORPEDO identify the target domain.</label> Then you will see another tooltip with information about the target URL and the target domain.
DetermineUrlButtonLinkDeaktivierung = TORPEDO has disabled the link so you can think about whether or not you want TORPEDO to identify the target URL.


T32Ueberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
T32Erklaerung = TORPEDO can not finally classify the risk of clicking on this link. <label class="highlight">At least one indicator that is often used in fraudulent e-mails to fool you was discovered.</label>You have to classify the risk yourself by checking the domain (bold area) of the URL very carefully.
T32Infotext = This means that the domain (bold area) of the URL and thus its trustworthiness is not known to TORPEDO. It is not among the most frequently visited domains in Germany. Also, URLs with this domain have not been visited many times by you in the past or have been identified as trustable by you in the past. In addition, TORPEDO has discovered at least one indicator that is often used in fraudulent e-mails to fool you. The indicators include e.g. 1) a difference between the displayed URL in the text and the deposited URL; 2) the fact that the domain of the URL behind this link is very similar to the ones identified as trustable by you or by TORPEDO; 3) if a URL is additionally displayed in the tooltip and it differs from the actual URL after the link.
T32GluehbirneText = <label class="highlight">Check the domain very carefully.</label> Does the domain (and not other parts of the URL) match the content of the message? Is the name of the domain spelled correctly? If you can not clearly review this, you should get more information. If the domain is not trustable, delete this email and / or contact support.
T32LinkDeaktivierung = TORPEDO has disabled the link so you can check the domain carefully.

T31Ueberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
T31Erklaerung = TORPEDO can not classify the risk of clicking on this link.  You have to classify the risk yourself by checking the domain (bold area) of the URL carefully.
T31Infotext = This means that the domain (bold area) of the URL and thus its trustworthiness is not known to TORPEDO. It is not among the most frequently visited domains in Germany. Also, URLs with this domain have not been visited many times by you in the past or have been identified as trustable by you in the past.
T31GluehbirneText = <label class="highlight">Check the domain carefully.</label> Does the domain (and not other parts of the URL) match the content of the message? Is the name of the domain spelled correctly? If you can not clearly review this, you should get more information. If the domain is not trustable, delete this email and / or contact support.
T31LinkDeaktivierung = 

T2Ueberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
T2Erklaerung = The risk of clicking this link is considered to be low because of your previous statements concerning the trustworthiness of the domain (bold area) of this URL.
T2Infotext = This means that you have called up URLs with this domain at least twice in the past by clicking on the link, or added this domain manually - e.g. via the TORPEDO settings -  to the list of trustworthy domains.
T2GluehbirneText =
T2LinkDeaktivierung =


T1Ueberschrift = Deposited URL (also called web address):
T1Erklaerung = The risk of clicking this link is considered to be low by TORPEDO because of the the trustworthiness of the domain (bold area) of this URL.
T1Infotext = This means that this domain was classified as trustworthy by the developers of TORPEDO because it is among the most visited domains in Germany.
T1GluehbirneText = 
T1LinkDeaktivierung = 


ShortURLUeberschrift = Referred URL (also known as web address):
ShortURLErklaerung = This domain (highlighted part) is not the target URL. You will be redirected to another URL. To classify the risk of the target URL, TORPEDO would have to detect the target URL.\n\nThis does not happen automatically, as the detection would put your privacy at risk.
ShortURLInfotext = From the structure of the referred URL TORPEDO recognizes that this is the domain of a short URL service.To detect the target URL, it is necessary to call up the short URL service. This would let the service provider know that you are potentially interested in this URL. Therefore, tasking TORPEDO with detecting the target URL would put your privacy at risk (even if you call up the short URL service yourself to detect the target URL). You can avoid this by asking the sender to send the target URL to you directly.
ShortURLGluehbirneText = Task TORPEDO to detect the target URL.
ShortURLLinkDeaktivierung = TORPEDO has deactivated the link to give you time to consider whether you want TORPEDO to determine the target URL.

URLnachErmittelnButton2Ueberschrift = The referred URL redirects you to the following URL:
URLnachErmittelnButton2Erklaerung = This domain (highlighted part) is not the target URL, either though. You will be redirected to another URL. To classify the risk of the target URL, TORPEDO would have to detect the target URL.\n\nThis does not happen automatically, as the detection would put your privacy at risk.
URLnachErmittelnButton2Infotext = The referred URL:\n<URL>\n From the structure of the referred URL TORPEDO recognizes that this URL will redirect you to the above target URL. This could be for several reasons. In any case the operator of the domain of the URL stored knows that you have clicked on the link. Therefore, your privacy is at risk here.\n\nFrom the structure of the target URL TORPEDO recognizes that this is the domain of a short URL service.To detect the actual target URL, it is necessary to call up the short URL service. This would let the service provider know that you are potentially interested in this URL. Therefore, tasking TORPEDO with detecting the target URL would put your privacy at risk (even if you call up the short URL service yourself to detect the target URL). You can avoid this by asking the sender to send the target URL to you directly.
URLnachErmittelnButton2GluehbirneText = Task TORPEDO to detect the target URL.
URLnachErmittelnButton2LinkDeaktivierung = TORPEDO has deactivated the link to give you time to consider whether you want TORPEDO to determine the target URL.

referrerInfo1 = A referrer is a service that provides to redirect to a foreign website through its own servers. The URLs used by the provider always have the same form and can be specified here for automatic deduction of the target URL.
referrerInfo2 = Many referrer use a randomly generated code in the redirection URL. TORPEDO checks if the URL starts with part 1 and deduces the URL chunk starting at part 2. You can just add Part 1 if there is no such code in the URL.
referrerDialogAdvHint = A referrer is a service that provides to redirect to a foreign website through its own servers. The URLs used by the provider always have the same form and can be specified here (Settings -> Account Settings -> Torpedo) for automatic deduction of the target URL.
